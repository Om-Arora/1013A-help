# 1013A-help

MQTT logs of 2 test flights done 2 minutes apart. The file `MQTTLog_2023-11-14_21-03-10.csv` was the first one and the `MQTTLog_2023-11-14_21-05-23.csv` was done later, both in positional flight mode.

## ToDo
I have the video of the 2nd test flight, will attach it asap.
Add the link back to my bell avr post.
